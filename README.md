# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Project Overview
New York city is home to a company called "Citibike" which allows people to rent bikes from convenient hubs located all around the Big Apple. After a hands-on, investigative outing to examine these bikes, I'm determined to bring them to Des Moines, Iowa. I've created a presentation, located here [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.lanphier/viz/NYC_Citibike_Tableau/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes](LINK GOES HERE "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thomas.lanphier/viz/NYC_Citibike_Tableau/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes"), using Tableau to convince investors to jump on what is bound to be a wildly successful venture.

## Analysis Results
### Top Starting Locations
The Citibike hubs are located throughout most of Manhatten, as well as the sides of Queens and Brooklyn closest to Manhatten. The first slide of the presentation shows the popularity of bike hubs for starting rentals. Note that the most popular locations are located in the mid to southern end of Manhatten, the most popular part of NYC.

### Overview of Check Out Times
The second slide explores the duration of rentals. It is easily apparent that most rentals are for less than half an hour. The most common duration is 5 minutes. This indicates that the bike is being used for a quick trip, which makes sense because people in NYC are much more likely to take the subway to get across city than they are to bike it. The second plot on this slide shows that a significant majority of rentals are done by persons identifying as male. This is helpful as it can give the marketing team a better idea of who to target. 

### Looking at Trips by Weekday
The third slide shows that 8am and 5pm are the times when the bikes are in greatest demand during the work week. This indicates that people are mostly using them for commuting during the work week. From Thursday through Sunday, the popularity shifts to between 8am and 7pm, which indicates the weekend crowd is rolling around (on Citibikes). For whatever reason, Thursday evening is the most popular time for the entire week. 

### Breakdown of Trips by Gender
The fourth slide examines the how gender effects usage times. The male and female riders seem to reflect the total rider usage. The unknown riders seem to not appear as much during the commuting hours, implying that they are probably tourists. 

### Examining Types of Users
The last slide shows that around 1 in 5 customers are subscribers, likely meaning they are residents. Also we see that there are no unknown genders of the subscribers. Subscribers ride substantially less on the weekends, which also supports the theory that subscribers are likely residents.

## Summary
### Conclusions
We learned that ~80% of riders are likely residents and the most popular bike hubs are the ones in the most popular parts of NYC. We can see that renting bikes will be a popular ventre in Des Moines as Des Moines isn't as popular as a tourist destination, but most riders seem to be residents.

### Future Explorations
Here are a few ideas to explore further through figures:
- What portion of the users are from NYC vs out of town?
- Rental duration as a box and whisker plot?
